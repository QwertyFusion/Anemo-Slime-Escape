**Anemo Slime Escape** is a fan-made game inspired by *Flappy Bird*, featuring an Anemo Slime from *Genshin Impact* as the main character. Navigate the slime through obstacles to earn points, avoid Zhongli's pillars, and break Geo constructs with a special attack to make your escape!

## Game Story
In this adventure, you control an Anemo Slime that’s trying to escape from Zhongli, the Geo Archon (Morax). His pillars stand in your way, and every missed step could be your last. Alongside these pillars, some obstacles include Geo Traveller constructs, which can only be destroyed by shooting an air bubble. Can you help the slime escape unscathed, or will Zhongli kill it?


## How to Play
- **Jump**: Press **Space** to make the Anemo Slime flap its wings and jump.
- **Attack**: Press **F** to shoot an air bubble at the Geo Traveller constructs.
  - Passing through Zhongli’s pillars earns you +1 point.
  - If you hit a construct without shooting it, the construct breaks, but the slime also perishes.
  - If you hit a construct and then pass through Zhongli's pillars, you earn +2 points.
- **Survival**: Avoid crashing into pillars or constructs. Use air bubble attack to break constructs that are blocking your path.
